Creating an API Service to support an online web application bookstore that targets a particular niche in
technology. The application, named Geek Text will need to support the following features:

Note: Each API Action is its own separate API route.

The REST API service must have the following components:

RESTful API: An API service that is exposed to the front using HTTPS exposing functional endpoints.

Backend Database: A Database of your choice to store the data which can only be accessed by the API.
The grading will be split into team components and group components. Each feature will be owned by a team member.
Each member will be graded for the completion and implementation of the feature that they own. This means that
although you will earn an overall team grade from the team components, each person in the team will be responsible
for a feature being done. If the feature is no completed, the individual who owns the feature will not receive the
implementation portion of the grade.
